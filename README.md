# House-Price-prediction
In today's information age, predicting property prices is far beyond such assumptions as house  size or number of bedrooms. Real estate prices are influenced by many subtle and sophisticated  variables that often go unnoticedâ€”anything from the neighborhood zoning designation to  basement finish quality.

This project explores a large real-world dataset from Ames, Iowa, with 79 explanatory 
variables that collectively determine the sale price of a house. These variables span across a 
variety of categories such as building materials, location, utilities, amenities, and much more. 
The objective is to dive deep into this data, uncover hidden patterns, and develop a robust 
regression model that can effectively predict house prices. 
Using powerful machine learning algorithms and feature engineering approaches, the project 
attempts to identify the determinants of house pricing. Either by employing tree-based methods 
like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting or through deeply optimized preprocessing 
pipelines, this problem is a challenge to modeling and analytical skills alike. It is not just about 
forecasting house prices but to get to the complexity of the housing market.
